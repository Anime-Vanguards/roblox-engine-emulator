//! AnimationTracks: Animator:LoadAnimation (and the Humanoid's and AnimationController's), the
//! track's playback members and events, and the Animator's step, which writes the blended pose into
//! the rig's Motor6D.Transform and Bone.Transform each frame. A track plays a KeyframeSequence
//! ([`clip`]) or a CurveAnimation ([`curve_clip`], measured in Studio; the curve instances' own
//! members are in `curves`). A track of either steps as Studio 0.747 steps one (measured with
//! Animator:StepAnimations in an edit session, docs/engine.md "Animation curves", Stepping; golden scripts in
//! `curve_golden/`):
//!
//! - The step runs after RunService.PreAnimation and before Stepped (the task scheduler's order), in
//!   play mode only (an Animator does not run in edit mode; Animator:StepAnimations steps one there); the
//!   Motor6D batch after PreSimulation then poses the parts in the same frame. That order is Roblox's
//!   documentation.
//! - TimePosition, WeightCurrent and the fade are float32 ([`advance`], [`fade_step`]). A fade (Play, Stop,
//!   AdjustWeight) starts from the weight the track has and takes effect with the next step, a fade of 0 too.
//!   A track whose fade is over and that is stopped, or whose target weight is 0, ends with the next step:
//!   Stopped if it was playing, then Ended, and it is stepped no more (its WeightCurrent stays as it was).
//! - Per joint, priorities from the highest down each take the smaller of their tracks' summed weight and
//!   what is left; tracks of one priority blend by their weights; whatever no track takes stays at the rest
//!   pose.
//!   A weight below 0.001 poses nothing. While an animator has a track that is stepped it writes every joint
//!   of its rig each step (the rest pose into those no track poses); with none it writes nothing, so the
//!   pose of a track stopped with a fade of 0 stays.
//! - A track that reaches its end without looping fires Stopped and fades out over 0.3 s. KeyframeReached
//!   (a KeyframeSequence's keyframes not named "Keyframe"; "End" for a CurveAnimation) and
//!   GetMarkerReachedSignal(name) fire for what the step passed. Events are deferred.
//! - Translations scale with the rig model's Scale (Model:ScaleTo scales the animations it plays).
//! - A track of an `active://` id follows its clip instance as scripts change it ([`clip_changed`]).
